This Is A RPG Card Game

<h1>Instructions</h1><br>
All is not well in the inter-galactic salad bar. The prepared foods are feed up and all-out war is about to break out. Pick your food and destroy all that would stand between you and your hunger. Choose wisely as each time you attack another food item they will counter attack. Will you be the last item standing? Start the game by selecting your player card. Then attack the opposing cards. Each attack builds your attack bonus and helps to reduce your opponent's health. However, each time you attack you will be counter-attacked. Last card remaining wins!

<strong>Food Stats</strong><br>
Health - The Amount of Damage The Item Can Sustain<br>
Attack - The Amount of Damage The Item Can Deal To Others<br>
Counter - The Amount of Damage You Will Take If You Attack The Item

<strong>The Real Deal</strong><br>
This game showcases DOM manipulation and logic using jQuery as there is minimal use of HTML. Almost everything you see here is generated by the jQuery and manipulated using functions. The code is scalable and set up using an array to hold objects. Those objects create the cards and HTML while event listeners take the data and update the original objects and array.  This is also built with Bootstrap and is mobile responsive.
